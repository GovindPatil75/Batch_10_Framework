Explain about Framework :
==============================
type of framework :in our project we are using Hybrid farmework with Test driven devlopment approach 
                   by using page object model design pattern with pagefactory
language :used Java language.
pom :as per the page object model,we have maintained class for every webpage ,each web page has seprate class and 
      that class holds members of that webpage,seprate classes for every individual test
Maven :using maven we build,execution and dependancy purpose.integratingthe testng dependancyin pom.xml file and running the 
        xml file using jenkins
TestNG : test managment tool used for Assertion and grouping executions
Packages : we have seprate packages like for test and pages ,all pom classes comes under com.PageObject package
           and all Test realted classes comes under test packages .
Utility : reason behind this to create utility is code resuability
          we have utility packages in which we maintain some classes with reusable functionality
          BaseClass --> which responsible for Browser open and closing ,also initializing the webdriver,implicit wait
          also create the object of config data provider class and exceldataprovider class .

properties file : we have config.properties file which have data realted with diffrent enviornment url
                  file paths and login credentials to read this data we load this config.peroperties file to 
                  configDataProvider class which palced under utility .
TestData : we stored test Data under TestData folder in spredSheet ,we have ExcelDataProvider class under utility to 
           read this test Data .
Library : we created one library class under Utility ,which contains common user defined reuable methods 
Reports : for reporting purpose we have Extent Reports ,its genrate beatiful html reports hich have logged
           all test Steps execution with status and Screenshot in Base 64 format.
version Control Tool : used git repository for version control and store scripts .
Jenkins : by using jenkins we schedule daily Automation script in nightly runs .Test result shared to peers after executions.
